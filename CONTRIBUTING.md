First off, wow! I love that you're interested in contributing to this project!

This project is primarily a self-indulgent, slow-and-deliberate look at Vulkan. With this project, I aim to understand the API and what a modern game engine based on it looks like.

That said, I welcome contributors to help reach that goal. I will more than happily review any pull requests, issues, and criticisms you might have.

Make sure to read the the README for a more extensive description of project goals, code convention etc., but even that stuff is open to critique.

Also before submitting make sure you understand the License and are aware of the Code of Conduct.

And thank you!
