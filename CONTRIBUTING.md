First off, wow! I love that you're interested in contributing to this project!

This project is primarily a self-indulgent, slow-and-deliberate look at Vulkan. With this project, I aim to understand the API and what a modern game engine based on it looks like.

That said, I welcome contributors to help reach that goal. I will more than happily review any pull requests, issues, and criticisms you might have.

Make sure to read the other docs for a brief description of code convention et. al., but even that stuff is open to critique.

Just don't be an ass.
